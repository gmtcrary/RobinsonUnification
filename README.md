# A Machine-Oriented Logic Based on the Resolution Principle

"A Machine-Oriented Logic Based on the Resolution Principle" by J. A. Robinson typeset in LaTeX.

The [pdfs](http://web.stanford.edu/class/linguist289/robinson65.pdf) available [online](http://ropas.snu.ac.kr/lib/dock/Ro1965.pdf) are extremely hard on the eyes. This repo is for the sake of preservation.

## Missing

[Page 12](https://web.stanford.edu/class/linguist289/robinson65.pdf#page=12) on the [linked PDF](http://ropas.snu.ac.kr/lib/dock/Ro1965.pdf#page=12) is slightly cut off on the right side. Currently that typesetting has been postponed until I can find a better scan.

## Dependencies

A working LaTeX distribution which includes `pdflatex` is required. On Debian/Ubuntu systems, the following packages should be sufficient.

To compile the LaTeX document, you need `latexmk`. On Debian/Ubuntu systems, you can install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install latexmk
```

In addition to latexmk, some additional formatting dependencies are required. These can be installed with:

```bash
sudo apt install texlive-latex-extra
```
